            <span> Hello people! Paul Tarabozzo here! </span>
            <span>
              Today I want to share my 9 tips for wedding photographers to make
              your life easier, attract more clients, and make them excited to
              work with you.

          <h3 class="a-prg__title">#1 – Ask more questions.</h3>
          <p class="a-prg__text">
            People who found you on the internet or through referrals most
            likely saw your photos and liked them if they decided to call you,
            so now it’s the time for them to like you personally. It is very
            important because for them it is an important day and they want to
            spend it with a photographer that is easy going, can cheer them up
            and fully understand what they’re looking for. Ask what they expect
            from a wedding photographer, what kind of pictures they like to
            have, what kind of guests they’re inviting. Show them that you care
            about their wedding more than about your own photography. When you
            have all info about your client and established a connection you can
            explain some aspects of your work based on their expectations.
            Usually, it leads to better cooperation from the clients and more
            bookings.

          <h3 class="a-prg__title">#2 – Guide your clients</h3>
          <p class="a-prg__text">
            If you’re a wedding photographer – most likely you’ve been to more
            weddings than your clients will ever visit in their whole life. It
            means that you’ve seen more, experienced more, and have an idea of
            what can go wrong on the wedding day or what can help them to save
            time and make the day much easier. For example, I usually start a
            day from the detail shots and ask brides to have the dress,
            necklace, earrings, shoes, invitations, and all rings to be at their
            getting ready location ready to shoot. Ask your bride to put all
            these items somewhere so you can start from them and then proceed to
            the rest of the coverage, otherwise, most likely you won’t have
            another opportunity to shoot all the details during the day. Such
            advice will show that you know what you’re doing and that you’re in
            charge and your clients don’t need to worry and can relax. It will
            make them very happy and as a result, they will recommend you to
            their friends.

          <h3 class="a-prg__title">#3 – Equipment</h3>
          <p class="a-prg__text">
            We all love different photography equipment- cameras, lenses, like
            to compare them, play with them, but the wedding day is the day when
            your equipment should work like a Swiss watch. Before arriving to
            the wedding make sure that you have all the necessary equipment in
            your bag, fully charged, and your cards are formatted and you have
            enough of them for the whole day and a few extra days just in case.
            Also, don’t come to the wedding with just one camera – it may cost
            you lots of nerves since you can’t ask the wedding to stop until you
            figure out what happened with your camera if it starts lagging, or
            if for some reason your memory card becomes corrupted. You need two
            cameras with you always. Regarding the memory cards – make sure your
            cameras have two card slots on backup, so each photo goes to two
            cards at the same time. In this way, you will eliminate any stress
            on or after the wedding.

        <div class="a-content__prg a-prg">
          <h3 class="a-prg__title">#4 – You’re at work, not at the party</h3>
          <p class="a-prg__text">
            As wedding photographers, we are supposed to establish a good
            connection with our clients to get better photos and make our
            clients happier with our services, but you need to remember, that
            we’re still wedding professionals meaning some small talks are fine,
            fine to tell some jokes to make your couple relaxed, but it’s not
            okay to spend hours talking with guests, being on the phone, or
            drinking alcohol – all this shows to your clients and to their
            guests that you are distracted, not performing your professional
            duties, but also you can easily miss some important moments. If you
            miss something because of scheduling mistakes, or because of the
            client – it is okay, but if you’re missing shots because you’re
            socializing – it’s total nonsense and I promise you’ll have
            troubles. Be 95% a professional and 5% a guest.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="a-content__prg a-prg">
          <h3 class="a-prg__title">#5 – Outfit</h3>
          <p class="a-prg__text">
            As wedding professionals we have to move a lot during the day, so we
            need to have some comfortable clothes that won’t limit our movement.
            An important moment here is that your comfortable outfit suppose to
            fit the wedding. You can’t wear sneakers with a huge Nike logo, with
            yellow pants and a light green shirt – you will attract much more
            attention than necessary. Try to find clothes that will be
            comfortable to walk, run, kneel and squat all day, but at the same
            time be dressy. You don’t have to wear a tuxedo – it will be
            overkill and usually looks weird, but some dressy casual will work
            perfectly. Think about yourself as a guest at a wedding with some
            twist to a comfortable side.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="a-content__prg a-prg">
          <h3 class="a-prg__title">#6 – Shoot everything</h3>
          <p class="a-prg__text">
            Most of the wedding photographers these days shoot digitally which
            means we are not limited in the number of photos we can take during
            the wedding day and it’s really stupid when a wedding photographer
            starts to count the photos trying to shoot “only important “ things.
            First of all, you never know what will be important for your
            clients, also thinking about shooting less make you less focused on
            the events happening around you. If you think that your clients need
            only getting ready shots, ceremony, bridal portraits, and reception
            think again. I’ve seen newbie photographers that got few shots of
            the bride getting ready and turn off their camera when mom suddenly
            starts to cry. You are there to cover every detail of the day and
            all the emotional responses of all the main people on the wedding
            day are essential.

        </div>
        <div class="a-content__prg a-prg">
          <h3 class="a-prg__title">#7 – Attention to details</h3>
          <p class="a-prg__text">
            Wedding is not just a main event – prep, ceremony, photoshoot, and
            reception. It’s a day full of feelings and emotions and we are as
            wedding photographers have to capture all the in-between, capture
            the emotion of the day, including weather, colors, textures, smell,
            temperature, and whatever else you can come up with. Everything is
            important and the difference between good and great wedding coverage
            is in such details.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="a-content__prg a-prg">
          <h3 class="a-prg__title">#8 – Tradition</h3>
          <p class="a-prg__text">
            I’ve shot dozens of different cultural weddings – Spanish, Italian,
            Turkish, Indian, Greek, Jamaican, and many others and can assure you
            that all these cultures are different and need some different
            approaches to the coverage. It is a good idea to ask your clients
            what kind of wedding they gonna have and what is important
            specifically for them. Let them explain to you what is the main
            feature of their wedding day, what kind of guests they will have,
            and what this particular culture focuses on during the wedding.

          <h3 class="a-prg__title">#9 – Know when to take a break</h3>
          <p class="a-prg__text">
            The last advice for today is kinda obvious but lots of photographers
            make this mistake – you have to know when to take a break. You can’t
            go to the washroom when the ceremony is already starting, you can’t
            go outside when the first dance is starting, you can’t go to call
            somebody when you have no idea what and when is the next event
            starts. You have to be on top of everything. Ask bride, planner, or
            MC to wait for you if there’s something that can’t wait. I believe
            you got the idea.
          </p>

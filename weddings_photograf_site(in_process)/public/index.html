              We went with the Lucky Package for our small wedding. We only invited the closest family and friends, and we were looking for photo+video coverage that would be discreet and that would do a good job capturing everyone and everything. Our photo and video guys were professional and very friendly, which is something my guests appreciated because we are usually camera-shy. So many amazing pictures, and the video is just sweet!

              Great guys! We only got a video package with them, because unfortunately by the time we found them we already had a photographer booked. I could see that the photographer always got in their way, and I can’t imagine how come their videos are eventually so good, because I was sure all I’m gonna see is this guy and his camera. They were so professional about it, it really speaks volumes.
